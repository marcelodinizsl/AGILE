@SCRUM

A framework within people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts and rules

#SCRUM THEORY
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is know.

TRANSPARENCY + INSPECTION + ADAPTATION

TRANSPARENCY - Aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. (Common definition of "Done")

INSPECTION - Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. 

ADAPTATION - An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize futher deviation.
	* Sprint Planning
	* Daily Scrum
	* Sprint Review
	* Sprint Retrospective
	
# SCRUM VALUES

ScrumTeam(Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect) -> (Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation)

# SCRUM TEAM

(Product Owner, Development Team, Scrum Master)
Scrum Teams are self-organizing and Cross-Functional. (Designed flexibility, creativity and productivity). Scrum Teams deliver products iterarively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.

Self-Organizing Team - Choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

Cross-Functional Team - Have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.

# PRODUCT OWNER
 Is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. He is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. 
 The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the Product Owner.
 
 The product backlog management includes:
  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and mission;
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum team will work on next;
  
# DEVELOPMENT TEAM
   The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
  - They are self-organizing. No one tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog  into increments of potentially releasable functionality;
  - Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment;
  - Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as whole;
  
# Development Team Size
  * Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains
  * Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraint durint the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable increment.
  * Having more than nine members requires too  much coordination.
  * Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage.
  * The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.
  
# The Scrum Master
  
  The Scrum Master is responsable for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices and rules. He helps everyone change the interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.
  
 # Scrum Master -> Product Owner
 - Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
 - Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
 - Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
 - Understanding and practicing agility;
 - Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed;
 
 # Scrum Master -> Development Team
 - Coaching the development team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
 - Removing impediments to the development team's progress;
 - Coaching the development team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood;
 
 # Scrum Master -> Organization
 - Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
 - Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;
 - Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team;
 
 # SCRUM EVENTS
  Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every has a maximum duration.
  The Sprint is a container for all events and each event in scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something
  
 $ The Sprint
  Is the heart of scrum, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product increment is created.
  Sprint -> Sprint planning, daily Scrums, the development work, the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.
  Each sprint as a definition of what  is to be built, a desing and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work and the result product.
  
 $ Cancelling a Sprint
 A sprint would be cancelled if the sprint goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction of if the market or technology conditions change. In general, a sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.
 Went a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" product backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releaseable, the product owner typically accepts. All incomplete product backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the product backlog.
 Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very uncommon.
 
 $ Sprint Planning
 
 sprint Plannling is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
 Sprint planning answers the following:
 
  - What can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint ?
   * After the development team forecasts the product backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the scrum team crafts a sprint goal. The sprint is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the product backlog, and it provides guidance to the development team on why it is building the increment.
   
  - How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?
   * Having set the sprint goal and selected the product backlog items for the sprint, the development team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product increment during the sprint. The product backlog items selected for this sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the sprint backlog. The work planned for the first days of the sprint by the development team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to  units of one day or less. By the end of the sprint  planning, the development team should be able to explain to the product owner and scrum master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the sprint goal and create the anticipated increment.
   
   $ Sprint Goal
   
   The sprint goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It's gives the Development Team  some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.
   As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprin Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint goal, it implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner negotiate the scope of Sprint backlog within the Sprint.
   
   $ Daily Scrum
   It's a 15 minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activites and create a plan for the next 24 hours. this is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.
   
   During the meeting, the development team members explain:
   
   * What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?
   * What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?
   * Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?
   
   The development team uses the Daily scrum to inspect progress toward the sprint goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the sprint backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the development team will meet the sprint goal. Every day, the development team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the sprint goal and create the anticipated increment by the end of the sprint.
   
   $Sprint Review
   It's held at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. During the sprint review, the scrum team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the increments is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration. This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month sprints.
   
   The sprint review includes the following elements:
   * Attendees include the scrum team and key stakeholders invited by the product owner;
   * The product owner explains what product backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done";
   * The development team demonstrates the work that is has "Done" and answers questions about the increment;
   * The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the sprint review provides valuable input to subsequent sprint planning;
   
   $Sprint Retrospective
   It's an opportunity for the scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint. It's occurs after the sprint review and prior to the next sprint planning.
   This is a three-hour time-boxed meetin for one-month sprints.
   
   The purpose of the sprint retrospective is to:
   * Inspect how the last sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process and tools;
   * Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements;
   * Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the scrum team does its work;
   
   During each sprint retrospective, the scrum team plans ways to increase product quality by adapting the definition of "Done" as appropriate. By the end of the sprint retrospective, the scrum team should have indentified improvements that will implement in the next sprint and this is the adaptation to the inspection of the scrum team itseal.
