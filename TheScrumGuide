@SCRUM

A framework within people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts and rules

#SCRUM THEORY
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is know.

TRANSPARENCY + INSPECTION + ADAPTATION

TRANSPARENCY - Aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. (Common definition of "Done")

INSPECTION - Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detec  undesirable variances. 

ADAPTATION - An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize futher deviation.
	* Sprint Planning
	* Daily Scrum
	* Sprint Review
	* Sprint Retrospective
	
# SCRUM VALUES

ScrumTeam(Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, Respect) -> (Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation)

# SCRUM TEAM

(Product Owner, Development Team, Scrum Master)
Scrum Teams are self-organizing and Cross-Functional. (Designed flexibility, creativity and productivity). Scrum Teams deliver products iterarively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.

Self-Organizing Team - Choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

Cross-Functional Team - Have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.

# PRODUCT OWNER
 Is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. He is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. 
 The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the Product Owner.
 
 
 The product backlog management includes:
  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and mission;
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum team will work on next;
  
  # DEVELOPMENT TEAM
   The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
  - They are self-organizing. No one tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog  into increments of potentially releasable functionality;
  - Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment;
  - Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as whole.
