#Scrum Theory
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is know.

TRANSPARENCY + INSPECTION + ADAPTATION

TRANSPARENCY - Aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. (Common definition of "Done")

INSPECTION - Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detec  undesirable variances. 

ADAPTATION - An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize futher deviation.
